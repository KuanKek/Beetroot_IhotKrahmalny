                        React Native is an open source framework for building 
                        Android and iOS applications using React and the app 
                        platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use 
                        JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to 
                        describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React 
                        components: <span class="s-italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>. You can learn 
                        more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs 
                        cover how components work in React Native.

                        <p>React Native runs on <span class="s-underline">React</span>, a popular open 
                            source library for building user interfaces with 
                            JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps 
                            to understand React itself. This section 
                            can get you started or can 
                            serve as a refresher course.

                        <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        
                        <p><span class="s-bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats 
                            in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names 
                            and a cafe to work in.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="s-bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:  <span class="s-after s-before s-background">Hello, I am your cat!</span>.</p>
        
                        <p>
                            The React docs have <span class="s-underline">a comprehensive guide to 
                            JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, 
                            you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a 
                            <span class="s-background">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly 
                            braces inside <span class="s-before"></span>
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            <span class="s-bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            <span class="s-bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments 
                            you use to configure how components render, state 
                            is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State 
                            is useful for handling data that changes over time 
                            or that comes from user interaction.
                             State gives your components memory!

                            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the 
                            user to enter text. It has an <span class="s-italic">onChangeText</span> prop 
                            that takes a function to be called every time the 
                            text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes
                             a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            For example, let's say that as the user types, 
                            you're translating their words into a different 
                            language. In this new language, every single word 
                            is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence 
                            "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
